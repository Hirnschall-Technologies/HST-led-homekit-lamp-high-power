# High Power LED Lamp (HomeKit enabled, dimmable)
I designed this LED lighting system as a replacement for old halogen R7S uplights.      
These lamps often use high power (400W) bulbs outputing (according to the manufacturer) around 8800 lumen. Meanwhile the only off the shelf LED uplights I could find output 2000 lumen while using around 25W. Furthermore, altough replacement cob LEDs for R7S sockets are available they are typically "20W". I tested several of them and they started at around 15W, after around one hour they only used 10W, they are not bright enough, and they started flickering from time to time.
